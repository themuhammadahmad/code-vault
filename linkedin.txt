Just Launched My Own Chrome Extension – A Secure QR Communication Tool

I'm excited to share something I've built from scratch — a Chrome Extension that lets users securely encode and decode messages using QR codes and a secret key.


🧠 Idea:

This is a personal idea and creation — designed to help people communicate secretly or store private information in a secure and portable way using QR codes.

🔍How It Works:

🔒Encode: Enter your message and a secret key → it encrypts the message and generates a QR code.
🔓 Decode: Scan or upload a QR code + enter the secret key → it decrypts the message and displays the original text.


🔐 Use Cases:

Secret communication between friends.
Offline storage of personal notes or passwords.
Physical sharing of encrypted data (e.g., printing the QR).
A fun and creative way to experiment with encryption.

⚙️ Built Using:

Framework: Plasmo 
Libraries:
jsonwebtoken
qrcode
qr-scanner


🧪 Everything happens locally in the browser — nothing is stored or sent anywhere.
This project was a great learning experience in security, QR technologies, and Chrome extension development. Would love to hear your thoughts!
